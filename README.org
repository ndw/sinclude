# sinclude

Saxon XInclude processor

This is an XInclude processor that operates on the Saxon data model.
It is not a streaming processor.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
XdmNode document = … // You got a document from somewhere, right?
XInclude xinclude = new XInclude();
XdmNode expanded = xinclude.expandXIncludes(document);
#+END_SRC

It supports the ~xmlns~, ~element~, ~text~, ~xpath~, and ~search~ fragment
identifier schemes.

I tried to build it in an extensible, pluggable way so that new
schemes could be added with relative ease, but that may be a bit
aspirational.

I’ve tested it with Saxon 10.1. It might work with earlier versions.
